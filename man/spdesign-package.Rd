\title{spdesign: Designing Stated Preference Experiments}
\description{
Contemporary software commonly used to design stated preference experiments are expensive and the code is closed source. This is a free software package with an easy to use interface to make flexible stated preference experimental designs using state-of-the-art methods. For an overview of stated choice experimental design theory, see e.g., Rose, J. M. & Bliemer, M. C. J. (2014) in Hess S. & Daly. A. \doi{10.4337/9781781003152}. The package website can be accessed at \url{https://spdesign.edsandorf.me}.
