\title{Generate the full factorial}
\usage{
full_factorial(attrs)
}
\arguments{
\item{attrs}{A named list of attributes and their levels}
}
\value{
A matrix containing the full factorial
}
\description{
\code{make_full_factorial} is a wrapper around \code{\link{expand.grid}} and
generates the full factorial given the supplied attributes. The attributes
can either be specified directly by the user or extracted from the list
of utility functions using.
}
\details{
The full factorial is often used as the starting point to generate a
candidate set. Note that the full factorial will include unrealistic and
completely dominated alternatives. It is therefore advised to use a subset
of the full factorial as a candidate set. The user can call
\code{generate_full_factorial} and create a subset that is passed to
\code{\link{generate_design}} using the `candidate_set` parameter, or supply
a set of restrictions through the list of design options `design_opt`.

The function is mainly used inside \code{\link{generate_design}} and
 appropriate restrictions are then put in place.

opts <- list(
