\title{Create formulas from the utility functions}
\usage{
utility_formula(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class utility}
}
\value{
A list of formula expressions for the utility functions
}
\description{
Create formulas from the utility functions such that we can create correct
model matrices.
}
\details{
Note that this function should be used on a cleaned utility expression and
**not** an updated utility expression. This is because we are converting
dummy coded attributes to factors prior to calling \code{\link{model.matrix}}.
This ensures that dummy coded attributes are correctly returned with the
model matrix.
