\usage{
calculate_efficiency_criteria(
  design_vcov,
  p = NULL,
  didx = NULL,
  all = FALSE,
  significance = 1.96,
  type
)
}
\arguments{
\item{design_vcov}{A variance-covariance matrix returned by
\code{\link{derive_vcov}} or returned by an estimation routine. The matrix
should be symmetrical and K-by-K}

\item{p}{A vector of parameters, e.g. the named vector of priors. This is
used for c- and s-errors. Default value is NULL}

\item{didx}{An integer indicating the position of the denominator in `p` This
is only used for c-efficiency. Default value is NULL}

\item{all}{If `TRUE` return a K or K-1 vector with parameter specific error
measures. Default is `FALSE`.}

\item{significance}{A t-value corresponding to the desired level of
significance. The default is significance at the 5% level with an associated
t-value of 1.96.}

\item{type}{A string indicating the type of efficiency criteria to calculate
can be either: "a-error", "c-error", "d-error" or "s-error"}
}
\value{

\description{
The function is a wrapper around \code{\link{calculate_a_error}},
\code{\link{calculate_c_error}}, \code{\link{calculate_d_error}} and
\code{\link{calculate_s_error}} to provide a unified interface for
calling and calculating efficiency criteria.
}
\details{
The function is mainly used internally to evaluate and report on designs,
but is exported to allow the user to use the function to calculate the
efficiency criteria of the model once it has been run on their data.
