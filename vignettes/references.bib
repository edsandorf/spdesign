	abstract = {We review the basic principles for the evaluation of design efficiency in discrete choice modelling with a focus on efficiency of WTP estimates from the multinomial logit model. The discussion is developed under the realistic assumption that researchers can plausibly define a prior belief on the range of values for the utility coefficients. D-, A-, B-, S- and C-errors are compared as measures of design performance in applied studies and their rationale is discussed. An empirical example based on the generation and comparison of fifteen separate designs from a common set of assumptions illustrates the relevant considerations to the context of non-market valuation, with particular emphasis placed on C-efficiency. Conclusions are drawn for the practice of reporting in non-market valuation and for future work on design research.},

The methods of discrete choice analysis and their applications in the modelling of transportation systems constitute a comparatively new field that has largely evolved over the past 15 years. Since its inception, however, the field has developed rapidly, and this is the first text and reference work to cover the material systematically, bringing together the scattered and often inaccessible results for graduate students and professionals. Discrete Choice Analysis presents these results in such a way that they are fully accessible to the range of students and professionals who are involved in modelling demand and consumer behavior in general or specifically in transportation - whether from the point of view of the design of transit systems, urban and transport economics, public policy, operations research, or systems management and planning. The introductory chapter presents the background of discrete choice analysis and context of transportation demand forecasting. Subsequent chapters cover, among other topics, the theories of individual choice behavior, binary and multinomial choice models, aggregate forecasting techniques, estimation methods, tests used in the process of model development, sampling theory, the nested-logit model, and systems of models.

	abstract = {Stated choice (SC) experiments represent the dominant data paradigm in the study of behavioral responses of individuals, households as well as other organizations, yet in the past little has been known about the sample size requirements for models estimated from such data. Traditional orthogonal designs and existing sampling theories does not adequately address the issue and hence researchers have had to resort to simple rules of thumb or ignore the issue and collect samples of arbitrary size, hoping that the sample is sufficiently large enough to produce reliable parameter estimates, or are forced to make assumptions about the data that are unlikely to hold in practice. In this paper, we demonstrate how a recently proposed sample size computation can be used to generate so-called S-efficient designs using prior parameter values to estimate panel mixed multinomial logit models. Sample size requirements for such designs in SC studies are investigated. In a numerical case study is shown that a D-efficient and even more an S-efficient design require a (much) smaller sample size than a random orthogonal design in order to estimate all parameters at the level of statistical significance. Furthermore, it is shown that wide level range has a significant positive influence on the efficiency of the design and therefore on the reliability of the parameter estimates.},

Many aspects of the design of a generic stated choice experiment are independent of its area of application, and until now there has been no single book describing these constructions. This book begins with a brief description of the various areas where stated choice experiments are applicable, including marketing and health economics, transportation, environmental resource economics, and public welfare analysis. The authors focus on recent research results on the construction of optimal and near-optimal choice experiments and conclude with guidelines and insight on how to properly implement these results. Features of the book include:  Construction of generic stated choice experiments for the estimation of main effects only, as well as experiments for the estimation of main effects plus two-factor interactions  Constructions for choice sets of any size and for attributes with any number of levels   A discussion of designs that contain a none option or a common base option   Practical techniques for the implementation of the constructions   Class-tested material that presents theoretical discussion of optimal design   Complete and extensive references to the mathematical and statistical literature for the constructions   Exercise sets in most chapters, which reinforce the understanding of the presented material   The Construction of Optimal Stated Choice Experiments serves as an invaluable reference guide for applied statisticians and practitioners in the areas of marketing, health economics, transport, and environmental evaluation. It is also ideal as a supplemental text for courses in the design of experiments, decision support systems, and choice models.

This paper proposes a randomized and scrambled version of the Halton sequence for use in simulation estimation of discrete choice models. The scrambling of the Halton sequence is motivated by the rapid deterioration of the standard Halton sequence’s coverage of the integration domain in high dimensions of integration. The randomization of the sequence is motivated from a need to statistically compute the simulation variance of model parameters. The resulting hybrid sequence combines the good coverage property of quasi-Monte Carlo sequences with the ease of estimating simulation error using traditional Monte Carlo methods. The paper develops an evaluation framework for assessing the performance of the traditional pseudo-random sequence, the standard Halton sequence, and the scrambled Halton sequence. The results of computational experiments indicate that the scrambled Halton sequence performs better than the standard Halton sequence and the traditional pseudo-random sequence for simulation estimation of models with high dimensionality of integration.},

	abstract = {Maximum simulated likelihood is the preferred estimator of most researchers who deal with discrete choice. It allows estimation of models such as mixed multinomial logit (MXL), generalized multinomial logit, or hybrid choice models, which have now become the state-of-practice in the microeconometric analysis of discrete choice data. All these models require simulation-based solving of multidimensional integrals, which can lead to several numerical problems. In this study, we focus on one of these problems – utilizing from 100 to 1,000,000 draws, we investigate the extent of the simulation bias resulting from using several different types of draws: (1) pseudo random numbers, (2) modified Latin hypercube sampling, (3) randomized scrambled Halton sequence, and (4) randomized scrambled Sobol sequence. Each estimation is repeated up to 1 000 times. The simulations use several artificial datasets based on an MXL data generating process with different numbers of individuals (400, 800, 1 200), different numbers of choice tasks per respondent (4, 8, 12), different number of attributes (5, 10), and different experimental designs (D-optimal, D-efficient for the MNL and D-efficient for the MXL model). Our large-scale simulation study allows for comparisons and drawing conclusions with respect to (1) how efficient different types of quasi Monte Carlo simulation methods are and (2) how many draws one should use to make sure the results are of “satisfying” quality – under different experimental conditions. Our study is the first to date to offer such a comprehensive comparison. Overall, we find that the number of the best-performing Sobol draws required for the desired precision exceeds 2 000 in some of the 5-attribute settings, and 20,000 in the case of some 10-attribute settings considered.},

Halton sequences are one example of such quasi-random number sequences, and various types of Halton sequences, including standard, scrambled, and shuffled versions, have been proposed and tested in the context of travel demand modeling. In this paper, we propose an alternative to Halton sequences, based on an adapted version of Latin Hypercube Sampling. These alternative sequences, like scrambled and shuffled Halton sequences, avoid the undesirable correlation patterns that arise in standard Halton sequences. However, they are easier to create than scrambled or shuffled Halton sequences. They also provide more uniform coverage in each dimension than any of the Halton sequences. A detailed analysis, using a 16-dimensional Mixed Logit model for choice between alternative-fuelled vehicles in California, was conducted to compare the performance of the different types of draws. The analysis shows that, in this application, the Modified Latin Hypercube Sampling (MLHS) outperforms each type of Halton sequence. This greater accuracy combined with the greater simplicity make the MLHS method an appealing approach for simulation of travel demand models and simulation-based models in general.},
