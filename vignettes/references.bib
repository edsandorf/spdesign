	abstract = {We review the basic principles for the evaluation of design efficiency in discrete choice modelling with a focus on efficiency of {WTP} estimates from the multinomial logit model. The discussion is developed under the realistic assumption that researchers can plausibly define a prior belief on the range of values for the utility coefficients. D-, A-, B-, S- and C-errors are compared as measures of design performance in applied studies and their rationale is discussed. An empirical example based on the generation and comparison of fifteen separate designs from a common set of assumptions illustrates the relevant considerations to the context of non-market valuation, with particular emphasis placed on C-efficiency. Conclusions are drawn for the practice of reporting in non-market valuation and for future work on design research.},

	abstract = {This note revisits the issue of the specification of categorical variables in choice models, in the context of ongoing discussions that one particular normalisation, namely effects coding, is superior to another, namely dummy coding. For an overview of the issue, the reader is referred to Hensher et al. (2015, see pp. 60–69) or Bech and Gyrd-Hansen (2005). We highlight the theoretical equivalence between the dummy and effects coding and show how parameter values from a model based on one normalisation can be transformed (after estimation) to those from a model with a different normalisation. We also highlight issues with the interpretation of effects coding, and put forward a more well-defined version of effects coding.},
